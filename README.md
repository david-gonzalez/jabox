About
-----
Jabox ALM is an open source Application Lifecycle Management platform. It provides a full-blown Java Enterprise Development Factory using your favorite tools, in less than 5 minutes.

It's purpose is to manage a seemless integration between Software Configuration Management ([SCM]), Issue Tracking System ([ITS]), Continuous Integration System ([CIS]), Repository Management System ([RMS]), Code Quality Management ([CQM]) and other tools in order to provide a complete Software Factory.

Its core is implementation agnostic and there are plugins that glue together each module, in order to provide better extensibility.

It supports automatic download and installation of the modules so that the whole installation process is managed directly by Jabox.

There are no external dependencies apart from a JRE and two port numbers (one for Jabox, and one for the Container of your ALM)
